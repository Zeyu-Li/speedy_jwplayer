# Speedy JW Player

## About

This project is a Chrome extension by: Andrew Li
It is a simple extension that modifies the speed of the JW Player (doesn't effect multiple JW Players, just the first one)

I use this to watch [South Park](https://www.much.com/shows/south-park/) on 2x speed

Of course, you can change the speed to a few presets
