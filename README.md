# Speedy JW Player

## About

This project is a Chrome extension by: Andrew Li
It is a simple extension that modifies the speed of the JW Player

I use this to watch [South Park](https://www.much.com/shows/south-park/) on 2x speed

Of course, you can change the speed to a few presets (default is 2 times speed). 
After changing speeds, you must reload/refresh the page

To install this program from source;

1. Download zip
2. unzip
3. Go to Chrome's extension page or [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Click **load unpack**
5. Find the unzipped folder
6. Enable
